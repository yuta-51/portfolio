### Background & Misc.
> Greetings! My name is Yuta Akiya and I am 21 years old. I was born in Okazaki, Japan and moved to Southern California when I was 3 years old. At 17, I graduated from Palm      Desert High School and enrolled into Cal Poly Pomona as a computer engineering student. My interest in computer engineering came from my hobby of putting together desktop computers. I wanted to know more about how they allow us to do everyday things like surf the web, display things to our monitors, and run applications.
