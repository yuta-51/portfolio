**Background**
I was born in Okazaki, Japan and moved to Southern California when I was 3 years old. At 17, I graduated from Palm Desert High School and enrolled into Cal Poly Pomona as a computer engineering student. My interest in computer engineering came from my hobby of building computers. I wanted to know more about the details of what happens inside the components of a computer and how it allows us to do things like surf the web and play video games. 


The Computer engineering cirriculum at Cal Poly, was centetered around eletrical engineering but featured a good amount of computer science concepts. I noticed that I was much more invested in the computer science aspect of the cirriculum. For my senior project, I decided to work on a deep learning project where I had a deep recurrnet neural network produce its own music. Completing this project and learning about python, data processing, and machine learning sparked my interest in pursuing a career path in software engineering or data analytics, engineering, or science. Not only is programming and working with data fun, but it also has the potential to make large, positive impacts for companies, which is one thing I value heavily: impactfulness of my work.
