# Background & Misc.
> My name is Yuta Akiya and I am 21 years old. I was born in Okazaki, Japan and moved to Southern California when I was 3 years old. During grade school, I played a total of 9 years of baseball including travel and high school level play. At 17, I graduated from Palm Desert High School and started my undergrad at Cal Poly Pomona as a computer engineering student. My interest in computer engineering came from my hobby of putting together desktop computers. I wanted to know more about how they allow us to do everyday things like surf the web, display things to our monitors, and run applications. I graduated from Cal Poly in May of 2021 and, since then, have been looking for entry-level or intern positions in a technical, data-related role.
