# Goal
The goal for this project is to create an ETL process that will ultimately load player salary data into a PostgreSQL data base. 




# Tools
Python
- pandas
- requests
- beautifulsoup
- psycopg2
- re (regex)
PostgreSQL
- Locally hosted database


# Procedure

# Step 1: Scrape Salary Data 
The website we will scrape data from is located [here](https://legacy.baseballprospectus.com/compensation/). The main table contains the total payroll for each MLB team. To reach the salary of individual players, the hyperlink within the table must be accessed. The hyperlink urls from the main table are scraped first so each team's player salary table can be accessed in a systematic way. To do this, the requests and beautifulsoup libraries are used to parse the website's html. A function is written to do these taks.


```python
def get_soup(url):
    r = requests.get(url)
    return BeautifulSoup(r.text, 'html.parser')
```


Next, the table element from the parsed html

# Step 3: Extract Team Data


# Step 4: Load Data into Database
