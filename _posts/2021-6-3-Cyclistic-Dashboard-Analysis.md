# Goal
Complete a capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Coursera course. In this hypothetical situation, we are working for a bike-share company which wants to maximize the
number of annual members that use their service. To do this, we will perform data analysis on 1 year's worth of bike ride data in multiple excel files. The insights gained
from this analysis will be used to drive new marketing strategies aiming to convert members to annual members. 


# Tools
- Python
- Tableau

# Challenges
- Thinking of metrics that can be used to comapre member vs. non-member behavior based on limited data. 
- Creating an intuitive, comparative dashboard without cluttering/overcomplexity. 



# Procedure

## 1. Import the data


## 2. Clean/Transform the data


## 3. Think of comparative metrics


## 4. Dashboard
The final dashboard can be seen [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/BikeShare_16295803525410/Dashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) on my Tableau profile.
