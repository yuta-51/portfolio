# Goal
Based on a dataset consisting of 10 features + the target variable (test score), create a model that can predict test score based on the student's attributes. 
We will be using linear regression as our model for this task.


# Tools
* Python
  * Pandas
  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
  * Sklearn

# Dataset Overview
## Features
- school: The school the student attends
- school_setting: The location of the school
- school_type: Either public or non-public
- classroom: classroom identifier
- teaching_method: Either experimental or Standard
- n_student: Number of students in the class
- gender: Student's gender
- lunch: Whether or not student qualifies for free/subsidized lunch.
- pretest: Pre-test score	
- posttest: Post-test score (target variable)
