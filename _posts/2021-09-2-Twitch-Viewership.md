# Background
Twitch.tv is a livestream platform focused mainly on video games. People livestream their gameplay and interact with their viewers through a chat system. In April 2021, Twitch had approximately 9.36 million active streamers, making it one the most popular livestremaing platform for gamers. It is extremely beneficial and common for video game creaters to partner with streamers and have them stream their game because it brings more peopel into their game, resulting in more revenue. 

In this project, we will specifically be focusing on Apex Legends streams. Apex Legends is a popular battle-royale game on both PC and console. This game was chosen due to its rise in popularity as well as my personal liking for it. 

# Goal
Gaining insights and finding trends in viewership/livestream data through extracting data from [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) using web scraping and API requests, loading the data into a Google Cloud Platform Cloud SQL database instance, analyzing the data and finally visualizing it using Tableau. 


# Challenges
- Difficult to web-scrape elements from Twitch due to how its website loads html elements.
- First time using GCP and creating a connection using Python to a cloud service. 


# Tools
Python
- pyodbc
- selenium
- requests
- json  
GCP Cloud SQL Database  
SQL  
Tableau
