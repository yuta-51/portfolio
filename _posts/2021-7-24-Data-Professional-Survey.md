# Goal
To perform data cleaning and analysis on the data to find informative insights/trends. As someone who hopes to find a career in the field of data, these insights may be useful for myself
and others who are in the same position. 

# Tools
Python
- Pandas
Tableau
- Dashboard


# Challenges


# Data Overview
The dataset is available [here](https://data.world/finance/data-professional-salary-survey).
Some notes that the dataset uploader left for us:
- The spreadsheet includes the results for all 3 years. We’ve gradually asked more questions over time, so if a question wasn’t asked in a year, the answers are populated with Not Asked.
- The postal code field was totally optional, and may be wildly unreliable. Folks asked to be able to put in small portions of their zip code, like the leading numbers.
